# Week 1 

Got spirograph working well. 

Tried to figure out fourier tansform drawing but was unable to reconstruct fourier transforms. I should look into this if I ever go back to my audio fft stuff.  



If I could do something differently I would allow for each radius to turn at speeds defined by the user (or an algorithm) rather than based on the ratios between radii. It would open the door to more interesting patterns and would be simple to implement
